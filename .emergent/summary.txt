The previous AI engineer initiated the development of CALC.IT, an online calculator service, from scratch. The process began with a detailed application description and environment setup guidelines. The AI engineer adopted a frontend-first approach, creating a functional, mock-data-driven UI. Extensive use of bulk file writes facilitated rapid component generation for various calculators and navigation pages.

Initial challenges included resolving frontend compilation errors related to icon imports and ensuring UI responsiveness via screenshot tools. After establishing a robust frontend, the user requested an auto-update feature for cryptocurrency rates. The AI engineer integrated the CoinGecko API for real-time data, enhancing the Crypto Converter with dynamic updates, status indicators, and error handling for API unavailability.

The current phase involves making all remaining in development calculators fully functional, as per the user's explicit request. The AI engineer encountered a  argument list length limit, necessitating a shift to creating these files individually. The project is currently in the process of completing all calculator functionalities.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of all remaining calculator components that are currently placeholders or marked as in development to ensure they are fully functional. This is a direct continuation of the last user request.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer's current work is focused on making all calculators fully functional, as per the user's explicit instruction: Но всё еще многие калькуляторы там находятся в статусе «в разработке или скоро» в общем не работают. Сделай их полностью работоспособными и полностью доделаными (But many calculators there are still in development or coming soon status, generally not working. Make them fully functional and completely finished).

Prior to this, the AI engineer successfully:
1.  **Initialized the CALC.IT application**: Set up the basic React frontend structure with pages for Home, Category, and a generic Calculator page.
2.  **Implemented core calculator components**: A significant number of calculators across various categories were created as frontend-only implementations, initially using mock data.
3.  **Integrated cryptocurrency API**: The  was enhanced to fetch real-time cryptocurrency exchange rates using the CoinGecko API. This involved adding:
    *   API call logic to .
    *   State management for , , and .
    *   Error handling for API failures, including a fallback to резервные курсы (fallback rates).
    *   UI elements to display the last update time, connection status (online/offline/fallback), and a manual refresh button.
    *   A warning box indicating that rates are fetched from a third-party API.
    *   A fix for number formatting ( utility) to correctly display decimals.
4.  **Performed extensive frontend testing**: Utilized the  to visually confirm UI correctness, navigation, and responsiveness across various pages (home, category, specific calculators like Compound Interest and BMI) and devices (desktop and mobile). Errors found during testing (e.g., in  icon imports) were promptly identified and fixed.

Currently, the AI engineer is in the process of implementing the remaining in development calculators. The last action indicates an attempt to create multiple calculator files at once using , which failed due to the command line argument limit. The plan is now to create these files individually. The application is in a state where many calculators function, but a subset still requires complete implementation of their calculation logic and UI.
